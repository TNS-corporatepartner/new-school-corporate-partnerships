Disruption is the new status quo. Corporations have the unique opportunity to partner with The New School’s industry-leading faculty and collaborative, innovative students from multiple disciplines in two- to three-day design jams and 15-week sponsored courses. Participants will use cutting-edge design thinking tools to find new solutions to their business challenges.
