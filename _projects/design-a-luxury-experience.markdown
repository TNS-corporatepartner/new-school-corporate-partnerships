Media Studies faculty and students bring to life the AIDS Memorial Quilt for the digital era. The AIDS Memorial Quilt, a breath-taking 1.3 million-square-foot quilt made by the families and friends of people lost to AIDS, is one of the largest ongoing pieces of community folk art in the world. Constantly traveling across the world in portions for exhibition value , the AIDS Memorial Quilt has never been seen in its entirety and cannot continue to withstand the physical contact it’s endured since 1987.  

Seeking potential solutions, the creative minds at The New School revolutionized the quilt, and public interactivity, by developing “Aids Quilt Touch”, a comprehensive digital experience. Using the latest touch technology, viewers can for the first time see the quilt in its entirety and zoom in an out of panels at a finger’s touch. The comprehensive digital experience also acts as a vehicle for thoughtful discourse - people can search the quilt for their loved ones by name, add comments to their patches, and generate new narratives with a community of like minds.

Aids Quilt Touch won a Digital Humanities Implementation Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and entry into SIGGRAPH 2015, a national convention for cutting-edge computer graphics and interactive techniques.
