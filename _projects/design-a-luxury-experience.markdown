Godiva chocolates, however divine, don’t just appear out of thin air— they’re meticulously crafted, wrapped and marketed. But can the pleasure of indulging in them and the brand be conveyed in the in-store shopping experience?

Godiva teamed up with students from The New School to find out. 

In 2016, the company launched Chocathon: Re-imagine the Godiva Chocolate Experience, a competition challenging students from various programs within The New School, including Parsons School of Design, to create a new store layout that focused on user experience, sustainability, and luxury. 

The students rose to the challenge, channeling their ongoing commitment to sustainable design to deliver solutions that Godiva would find inspiring and effective. Through collaboration and mixing disciplines, these student teams designed a space for Godiva that allowed the company to take risks and innovate in ways that point to the future of sustainable chocolate making. 

The winning proposed space was one in which Godiva could conduct research on their customers’ responses to their products and showcase new sustainable packaging designs and recipes that match their luxurious and thoughtfully considered brand.
