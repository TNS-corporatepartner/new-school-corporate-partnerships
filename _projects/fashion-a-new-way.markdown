MasterCard teamed up with The New School’s Parsons School of Design students to bring a forward-thinking  approach to  payment transactions.

During a  Fashion and Design Hack, students developed solutions and built prototypes for connected commerce by including payments functionality into every-day consumer products, new designs and concepts. One winning team designed a microchip that could be inserted into the insole of a shoe, allowing a consumer to pay by simply stepping on an NFC-enabled foot reader. Another team revolutionized the traditional handshake, by created a small, hand-held chip device that could be worn in a palm and would register payment upon handshake. The final winning team embedded a payments chip in a pair of sunglasses and created an open source database to allow designers to install payment capabilities in their own designs.

The day-long Fashion and Design Hack imagined a future where money and payments became a seamless part of the consumer’s daily experience and expands on MasterCard’s initial effort to find, develop and launch new applications better integrated into the lifestyles and needs of the Millennial generation.
