Orchestral musicians traditionally drape themselves in black to enhance and grant priority to their sound. The New School, in partnership with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, sought to explode the senses by developing garments that explored the intersections of performance, fashion, design, sight and sound.

Garments containing innovative, sustainable and wearable technologies were created to visually illuminate in sync with musical composition; a syncopated piano march shot red crystals across the pianist’s all-white cape and with every drummer’s beat, green spheres and triangles met onscreen for a tiny fox-trot.

Music becomes a fully immersive experience where you can hear color and see sound, and songs that are familiar resonate in a whole new way.
