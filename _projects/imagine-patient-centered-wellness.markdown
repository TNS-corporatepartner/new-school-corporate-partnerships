For *Hack Health*, a two-and-a-half-day-long "design jam," small teams of students from Parsons School of Design and The New School for Social Research brought their innovation-focused design thinking and experience with digital platforms to create new, cutting-edge healthcare solutions. 

After identifying their particular healthcare challenges, these teams designed innovative products, services, and platforms built upon new approaches to data and privacy in healthcare. They then pitched these patient-centered plans to a panel of judges made up of leading industry experts: Christian Madsbjerg, Senior Partner of ReD Associates; Marc Lafleur, Vice President for Insights Health at Idea Couture; Kate McCarthy, Senior Analyst at Forrester Research; and Sashi Padarthy, Head, Digital Design and Innovation at Cognizant.

The winning proposals ranged from an algorithmically driven service that combats caregiving fatigue by reaching out to patients through a social media care network to a patient record system that makes use of the portability of digital technologies. The success of this partnership between the New School and Cognizant Digital Works has led to the development of a breakout course running in Spring 2017 entitled, which is titled Ethnography, Data, and Healthcare Innovation.
