The Empowerhouse project defied traditional housing constraints to prove that innovative housing can not only be sustainable, but affordable and efficient.  With partners including Habitat for Humanity, students across The New School worked with community partners in low-income neighborhoods to design sustainable solar-powered homes at the cutting edge of technology. From automated lighting fixtures, to zero energy heating and cooling systems, to self-irrigating gardens and humanely designed interiors, Empowerhouse is proof that great designs can nourish a community, revolutionize an industry, and minimize cost.

Empowerhouse was a winner of the Affordability Category in the U.S. DOE Solar Decathlon. Piloted in Washington, DC, it is now being expanded to cities around the US.
