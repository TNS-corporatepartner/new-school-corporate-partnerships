Students from across Parsons School of Design partnered with Intel during a semester-long class to understand how new forms of sensors could be woven into fabrics and revolutionize the way people interact with their clothing.  New designs with embedded technology were adaptive to the wearer’s needs and increased the ability for the wearer to showcase their personality in every environment.

One team, inspired by the cuttlefish, developed shape-changing garments that would adapt to the event, environment, and time of day, allowing a busy urban dweller to have the perfect outfit for any situation. Another collection featured four styles of jackets, equipped with e-ink screens, which display the wearer’s interests. A third team developed clothing with embedded sensors that learned the wearer’s psychological and behavioral patterns and leveraged an AI app to trigger massages when stress was sensed.

The collaboration between design and technology created new ways to merge form and function in fashion.
